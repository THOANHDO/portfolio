# Portfolio Landing Page Source

This repository contains the static landing page for the IT Comtor & Translator portfolio. To obtain the source code locally, follow these steps:

## Clone with Git

```bash
# using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
# or using SSH
# git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO.git
```

After cloning, change into the project directory:

```bash
cd REPO
```

Replace `USERNAME` and `REPO` with the actual owner and repository name.

## Download as ZIP from GitHub

1. Navigate to the repository page in your browser.
2. Click the **Code** button.
3. Choose **Download ZIP**.
4. Extract the downloaded archive and open it in your preferred editor.

## Direct Copy from Existing Files

If you already have access to the deployed site and only need the raw files:

1. Open the deployment in your browser.
2. View page source (`Ctrl+U` / `Cmd+Option+U`).
3. Save the HTML, CSS, and JS files to your local machine.
4. Recreate the original folder structure:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/css/style.css`
   - `assets/js/app.js`

This ensures animations, styles, and scripts work as expected when opened locally or hosted on GitHub Pages.
